<INSTRUCTIONS>
- **Gemini check for imagery**
  * Before adding new photos or background images to the experience, consult this file to remind yourself to add descriptive text for screen readers.
  * Use the Gemini workflow only to validate copy/alt text summarization if requested; otherwise rely on manual review.
  * When adding a new image, document whether alt text was provided and what it says (e.g., “New hero photo `pages/Home.tsx` now describes the chiropractor’s hands supporting the patient.”).
  * If there is any uncertainty about whether the alt text is sufficiently descriptive, note that the user should re-evaluate the phrasing or supply additional context.
