John Heath
John Heath is an attorney at Cosmic Law Firm with a specialty in entertainment and intellectual property.

After working in the record industry and attaining success in the music industry himself as a recording artist, Mr. Heath went on to attain a Masters Degree in Mass Communication at San Jose State and Juris Doctor at Whittier Law School, with a certificate in intellectual property. In addition to civil litigation, John D. Heath has a background in entertainment litigation, trademark and copyright pre-litigation, intellectual property, and entertainment transactional law. 

Heath understands the entertainment business and content creation in a meaningful way. This is not surprising, as Heath was raised in the vortex of Hollywood. His father was a successful and prolific television writer and his mother is a premier entertainment attorney who represented virtually every major studio during her nearly forty year career. Additionally, his step-father is a well-respected Israeli-American director. But Heath adds music and much more to the family tree, having obtained a recording deal with a prominent independent label almost straight out of college. Heath is currently in the process of developing other movies and television series, but none with more passion than his commitment to “Tigers From the Sun.”

Heath instantly was drawn to the fascinating story of “Tigers from the Sun” and its real life protagonist, Claire Lee Chennault, whose determination and unwillingness to accept the paradigms of the day made him a hero for the ages. Heath is thrilled with the idea of bringing the yet untold tale of Chennault to life as a feature film and eager to work with his colleague, the very talented Jean Kwon of Cosmic Law Firm, as a co-executive producer.
