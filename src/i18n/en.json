We strongly believe that the key to our success comes from this wide spectrum of experience. For example, because we have successfully litigated multiple breach of contract cases on both sides, we know what the key sticking points and traps are when drafting or reviewing contracts and advising clients, and vice-versa. This experience has proven invaluable and is a key trait that most transactional-only law firms cannot offer. Our clients also have the peace of mind that even for transactional matters, we have the litigation expertise to vigorously fight any disputes that may occur in the future both informally and in court."
